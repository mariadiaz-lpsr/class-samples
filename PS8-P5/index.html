                <h3>Sabrina Carpenter</h3>
                        <p>She is a bad young singer since she is barely 16. The talent she has is magnificient, an example is on her song Smoke & Fire.</p>

                <h4>Christina Aguilera</h4>

                        <p>He is a bachata singer, whenever you listen to his songs you feel like you want to dance. </p>

                <h6>Ellie Goulding</h6>
                        <p>Her songs are just beautiful since for one of her songs she dedicated it for her bestfriend. That was like the sweetest thing in the song "Army." Also her song Something In the Way You Move leaves us moving throughout the whole song. </p>
